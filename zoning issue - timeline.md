    - __(a) Initial Fact-finding and Meetings__
- [[July 9th, 2019]]
    - Citing Blue Line overcrowding and general congestion, neighbors say former Ald. Joe Moreno (1st) lied to them and pushed a "greedy" development through council.
    - Now, neighborhood groups are leaning on new Ald. Daniel La Spata (1st) to roll back the zoning change 
    - Sneed and other Wicker Park Committee board members 
        - have asked [[First Ward Ald. La Spata]] 
        - to use his [[aldermanic prerogative]] to **retroactively downzone** the property. 
        - ^^While **downzoning** is **perfectly legal**^^
            - ^^**he doesn’t want to do it.**^^

            - [[First Ward Ald. La Spata]] said he wants to assess whether 
                - Moreno’s move to **approve the change on April 10** 
                - violated the [[Open Meetings Act]].
    - [[Ald. Scott Waguespack (32nd)]] 
        - said he did not believe the Open Meetings Act had been violated on April 10.
        - “[It’s] not applicable, as the meeting was open,” 
        - ^^“[There’s] **no requirement** to post agenda with each and every item to be voted on in advance.”^^
        - ^^Waguespack said it’s possible nearby property owners could** have a legal case** that zoning is **“capricious” and harmful to their property values or their quality of life**^^
            - Increasing crowding on the Blue Line, for example, is a problem, the Bucktown alderman said.
        - “From our perspective, the problem with high-rise development is that it focuses an area’s ^^development potential on a **single lot to the detriment of** the future development potential of **surrounding lots** and moves away from the **pedestrian-oriented scale** of development that maintains people’s connection to the street^^,”

- [[May 28th, 2020]]
    - Instead, the freshman alderman tried to 
        - broker a compromise between property owner Robert Mosky and neighborhood leaders. 
        - That plan ultimately didn’t work out, La Spata said.
    - [[First Ward Ald. La Spata]]
        - introduced an ordinance at City Council
        - change the zoning of the project to “B-3-2,”
            - classification that allows retail stores 
            - but restricts the height to about 50 feet, tall enough for about four stories
- ## July 2020
    - I'm confused because **before going under contract** in July 2020 
        - [[Kerry]] from [[Vermillion]] 
        - told my agent and me that because of the lawsuit they filed 
            - (I'm not sure if it was against the city because of the outgoing alderman's approval or the other developer) 
            - there's no chance it would get zoning approval to be more than 5 stories. 
            - I think it was was originally planned to be 14 stories now it looks like its 13, 
                - so is that the "down zoning" that occurred? 
            - I can't say I'm at all shocked that vermillion didn't disclose anything but am nonetheless disappointed and concerned

            - ^^that realtor was informed that it would be legal to construct a 17-story building at 1628 West Division ^^
